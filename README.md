Why
==
In a nutshell, there are too many awesome lists :)  
We hope to build a tool to access them more quickly.  
And hope this would be a helpful idea.

Supported awesome lists
==
It is version 0.0.1 version for now, only two awesome lists we parsed for now :sorry:
- [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- [awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)

The format of awesome lists vary, so building a general parsing program is not easy for us for now.  
We use this simple [tool]((https://github.com/lockys/awesome.json)) to parse these lists.
